# Dotfiles
My personalized collection of dotfiles

#### Polybar Fonts:  https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/tree/master/use-on-desktop


**Notes:** 
1. The **checkupdates** script gives the count of number of upgradable packages. To make it work with polybar, copy the script to the **usr/bin/** directory.  
2. Install **scrot** and **xclip** for screenshots.
